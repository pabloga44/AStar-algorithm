# AStar-algorithm

Here you have an implementation of the A* Star algorithm to find the shortest way between two points in a weighted graph.
This case is implemented to the case of the map of Catalonia containing 3472620 nodes and 201235 ways of the streets and roads of the region, 
collected by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project.    

The csv with the list of nodes and ways of the map is stored in the compressed folder _data.zip_ that you must unzip in order to run the program. The folder must be also name _data_ and be stored in the main folder of the project.  
In the _src_ folder there are the two main programs of the algorithm. The first _AStar\_write_
The example implementation looks for the shortest path from Lleida to Girona, but
